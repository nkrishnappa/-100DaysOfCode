Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.


# There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
# OUTPUT - You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
