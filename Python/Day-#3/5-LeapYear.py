Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. 
A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
    **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
        **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
